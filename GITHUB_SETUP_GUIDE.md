# GitHub Setup Guide for BTP Project

This guide will help you push your BTP project to GitHub.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Make sure you have a GitHub account
   - If not, create one at https://github.com/join

2. **Git Installed**: Verify git is installed
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   If not installed, download from https://git-scm.com/

3. **GitHub Authentication**: You'll need either:
   - Personal Access Token (recommended)
   - SSH Key

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `BTP-IoT-Healthcare-Monitoring` (or your choice)
   - **Description**: `IoT-Based Healthcare Monitoring System using Machine Learning`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"
4. **Copy the repository URL** (you'll need this in Step 3)

---

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Project

Open Terminal and navigate to your project:

```bash
cd /Users/harshitraj/BTP
```

Initialize git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Configure your git identity (if not already done):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

---

### Step 3: Add Remote Repository

Add the GitHub repository as remote (replace URL with yours):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

Example:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshitraj/BTP-IoT-Healthcare-Monitoring.git
```

Verify remote was added:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

### Step 4: Add Files to Git

Add all files (respects .gitignore):

```bash
git add .
```

Check what will be committed:

```bash
git status
```

You should see:
- ✅ Source code (src/)
- ✅ Documentation (reports/, docs/, *.md)
- ✅ Configuration (requirements.txt, .gitignore)
- ✅ Scripts (run_*.sh)
- ✅ Metadata (preprocessing_metadata.json)
- ❌ Large data files (ignored)
- ❌ Models (ignored)
- ❌ Virtual environment (ignored)

---

### Step 5: Create Initial Commit

Commit your files:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: BTP IoT Healthcare Monitoring System

- Data integration pipeline
- Comprehensive preprocessing framework
- MLP implementation (9-class posture classification)
- Complete documentation and reports
- Organized directory structure
- Ready for improvements (IMU integration planned)"
```

---

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

#### Option A: Using HTTPS (with Personal Access Token)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name: "BTP Project"
   - Select scopes: Check "repo" (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enter credentials when prompted**:
   - Username: your GitHub username
   - Password: **paste your Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password!)

#### Option B: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 7: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository URL
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see all your files!

---

## What Gets Uploaded

### ✅ Included in Git (Small files, ~5 MB total)

```
✅ src/
   - python.py
   - data_preprocessing.py
   - mlp_implementation.py

✅ reports/
   - PREPROCESSING_REPORT.md
   - MLP_FINAL_REPORT.md

✅ docs/
   - IoT-Healthcare-Datasets-Report.pdf

✅ Root files:
   - README.md
   - DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md
   - PRESENTATION_CONTENT.md
   - GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - requirements.txt
   - .gitignore
   - run_preprocessing.sh
   - run_mlp.sh

✅ Configuration:
   - data/preprocessed/preprocessing_metadata.json

✅ Directory structure:
   - Empty directories with .gitkeep files
```

### ❌ Excluded from Git (Large files, ~500 MB)

```
❌ data/raw/*.csv, *.xlsx, *.zip (too large)
❌ data/preprocessed/*.npy (numpy arrays)
❌ models/*.keras (model files)
❌ results/visualizations/*.png (images)
❌ results/metrics/*.json, *.txt (can be regenerated)
❌ venv/ (virtual environment)
```

**Why excluded?**
- Too large for GitHub (would slow down cloning)
- Can be regenerated by running scripts
- Not necessary for code review
- GitHub has 100 MB file size limit

## Complete Command Sequence

Here's the complete sequence of commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/harshitraj/BTP

# Initialize git
git init

# Add remote (replace with your URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: BTP IoT Healthcare Monitoring System"

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "remote origin already exists"

**Solution:**
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

### Problem 2: "Authentication failed"

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're using Personal Access Token, not your GitHub password
- Verify token has "repo" scope
- Check username is correct

### Problem 3: "Large files detected"

**Solution:**
- Check .gitignore is working: `git status`
- If large files are staged, unstage them: `git reset`
- Update .gitignore and try again

### Problem 4: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**Solution:**
- Use HTTPS instead of SSH
- Or set up SSH keys: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## Future Updates

To push future changes:

```bash
# Make your changes to files

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push
git push
```

---

## Example: Pushing After IMU Integration

After you implement IMU integration:

```bash
cd /Users/harshitraj/BTP

# Stage new/modified files
git add src/
git add reports/
git add data/preprocessed/preprocessing_metadata.json

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add IMU sensor integration

- Integrated accelerometer and gyroscope data
- Expanded features from 4 to 10
- Retrained MLP with improved accuracy (75%)
- Updated documentation and reports"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

**Good:**
```
✅ "Add IMU data integration for improved accuracy"
✅ "Fix preprocessing bug in blood pressure parsing"
✅ "Update README with new results"
```

**Bad:**
```
❌ "Update"
❌ "Fix"
❌ "Changes"
```

### 2. Commit Frequency

- Commit after completing a logical unit of work
- Don't wait too long between commits
- Commit before major changes

### 3. Branch Usage (Optional)

For major features, use branches:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/imu-integration

# Make changes, commit

# Push branch
git push -u origin feature/imu-integration

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Merge when done
```

---

## Repository README Preview

Your GitHub repository will show README.md as the main page, which includes:

- Project overview
- Directory structure
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Results summary
- Future improvements

This makes your project professional and easy to understand!
